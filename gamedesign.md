### First draft notes
Name: This symbiosis world of ours
Genre platform-adventure metroidvania?
2.5D or 3D. Maybe something like Ori and the Blind Forest?
You are a spectral animal which has gained some sort of spiritual powers from the sea and land. 
You live in the inbetween area of land and sea
You use these powers seem to be all of a sudden lost
You figure out that the spirits of the sea and land are no longer in harmony of borrowing from each other and have now stolen each others cores
This have made it so you lost your powers and the whole world is in grave danger
The sea is furious and attempts to take the land back to the sea, while the land is poisoning the sea and making the world harmful
Your task is to reunite the two spirits (land and sea) and return the cores to each other to prevent the absolutt death of the world
You need to traverse the deepest of the dark waters as well as the highest of skies along the way
You gain some of your powers back while on the adventure by finding slivers of the cores spread around.
Along the way you have to fight the forces of the sea and land as well as traverse the different lands and obstacles

### Engine
Unity seems to be the logical choice
A Lot of support material around it to make the learning curve not as steep.

### Gameplay wishlist
Player interaction
Multiplayer (co-op)
Abilities/special attacks (4-5 of em)
Interesting movement (sprint, crouch/slide, wall-jump).
Different challenges based on environment (movement speed)
Customizable controls
Controller support????


### Rough draft
Start off without most powers, and eventually you gain your powers back through various challenges.
Could gain “fragments” of your eventual powers (cores).
When all cores are in their correct place, harmony gets restored (earth core shouldn’t be underwater).  
Player is the avatar? Random spirit creature that feels called to help?
Based on climate change? (pollution from earth, into water and air)
Sky, Sea and Soil (Land).

#### Game Timeline
Starting with the character doing basic errands (tutorial section)
Cut to seeing the greater spirits of the land and the sea fighting
Player is dropped into the world, and told that they need to restore balance, and help the greater spirits find peace by the elder spirit or whatever.
Got to find parts of the land’s and the sea’s core to give them back and restore your abilities

The map is split into sections, kinda like this: (This is from game seasons after fall)

Each section has puzzles/tasks the player has to solve in order to save the area and open the path to the next
Along the way they find parts of the cores, for each the spirit picks up they gain new abilities that can help them in other areas
There are two paths each leads to the greater spirits of the land and sea where we can meet them/have boss fights?

Where are we:
What do we need to do:
Why?:
What is the result?:
Where do we need to go next?:
Repeat for each core(?).


### Movement List (ideas)
Could be compatible with controllers ;)
A-D Left and right walking
W/spacebar Jump
S/CTRL Crouch/descend from platform
Shift Sprint
Alt Slow movement
Hold Spacebar Glide (Sky only?)
Left click Light attack
Shift + left click Heavy attack

### Game Levels/Environment

### Animations
3d sprite with imported animations converted into a 2D sprite in order to have fluidity.

### “Roles”:
Mats: Audio / Abilities / Orbs
Lillian: Character Design, Visual work, glowing ,parallaxing  
Sarah: Pushing and Pulling / Swimming / Enemies / Health
Lars: Level layout / puzzle design / Abilities / Attack and health / Music / Dialog

### Potential Abilities:
Focus on passive abilities, or abilities that can be swapped out in an “inventory wheel”:
Double Jump
Glide/slow fall
Heavy Ranged attack
Light Ranged attack
“Night vision”/ Lumination
Dash/blink

### Mats’ questions:
Map design: Do we want 1 “level” per core? Or 1 large map where all the cores are located and the player needs to find the cores somewhere in the map?

### Potential narrators: 
After the spirits fight and are scattered, the player gets a small fragment of both the spirits. The fragments hold the consciousness of the elements, and the player uses this opportunity to directly show what their elemental battle is doing to their respective lands in order for them to learn, and make amends. Water sees the damage water has done, earth sees the damage pollution has done.

### Concept:
Grand spirits (air and earth) are fighting due to pollution, their cores scattering to their opponents area after their battle. This creates a massive elemental shift, as the water now controls the powers of the earth, and the earth controls the powers of the water. 
Main character needs to reclaim the cores, and has to replenish balance.
The cores can be unlocked in any order, but you need 3 cores to “complete” the core/key to go to the boss level. Having ⅓ of the cores will give you the 1st power, ⅔ of the core will give you the 2nd, and you gain the element’s “full power” when you’ve fully combined the core.

### Name suggestions for character:
Elani
Yurei
Cyclos (Life)
Aerie
Ethae
Spryte
Zion
Lyte
Tirips
Zip
sisoibmys
